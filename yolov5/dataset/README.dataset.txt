# Overview

The `Mask Wearing` dataset is an object detection dataset of individuals wearing various types of masks and those without masks. The images were originally collected by Cheng Hsun Teng from Eden Social Welfare Foundation, Taiwan and relabled by the Roboflow team.

# Use Cases

One could use this dataset to build a system for detecting if an individual is wearing a mask in a given photo.

# Using this Dataset

Use the `fork` button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings (perhaps resized for your model's desired format or converted to grayscale), or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better.
